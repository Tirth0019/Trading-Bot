## ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas Identified for Improvement

### 1. Event Timing Issues (3 issues)
- **Problem**: Very long gaps between events (avg 99.5 hours)
- **Impact**: May miss important intermediate market moves
- **Recommendation**: Implement intermediate event detection for long periods

- **Problem**: Multiple consecutive CHOCH events (3 in a row)
- **Impact**: May over-detect trend changes
- **Recommendation**: Add event consolidation logic

### 2. Price Level Management Issues (4 issues)
- **Problem**: Large price clusters detected (2 clusters with >2 events)
- **Impact**: Multiple events at similar price levels may indicate noise
- **Recommendation**: Implement price clustering detection and consolidation

- **Problem**: Level TJL1 broken 4 times, SBR broken 5 times, RBS broken 5 times
- **Impact**: Levels broken multiple times may need stronger validation
- **Recommendation**: Strengthen level validation rules

## üí° Specific Improvement Recommendations

### High Priority Improvements

#### 1. Event Consolidation Logic
```python
# Add logic to consolidate consecutive events of same type
def consolidate_consecutive_events(events, time_threshold=12):
    """Consolidate consecutive events within time threshold"""
    # Implementation needed
```

#### 2. Price Clustering Detection
```python
# Add logic to detect and consolidate price clusters
def detect_price_clusters(events, price_threshold=20):
    """Detect events within price proximity and consolidate"""
    # Implementation needed
```

#### 3. Enhanced Level Validation
```python
# Strengthen validation for frequently broken levels
def validate_level_strength(level_name, break_count, price_history):
    """Validate if level should be considered valid after multiple breaks"""
    # Implementation needed
```

### Medium Priority Improvements

#### 4. Intermediate Event Detection
```python
# Add detection for intermediate moves during long gaps
def detect_intermediate_events(structure, max_gap_hours=48):
    """Detect intermediate structure changes during long gaps"""
    # Implementation needed
```

#### 5. Dynamic Confidence Thresholds
```python
# Adjust confidence thresholds based on market conditions
def adjust_confidence_threshold(market_volatility, trend_strength):
    """Dynamically adjust confidence requirements"""
    # Implementation needed
```
